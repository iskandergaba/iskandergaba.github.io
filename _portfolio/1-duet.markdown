[Duet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kumobius.android.duet) is a great fun mobile arcade game developed by [Kumobius](http://www.kumobius.com/). The idea behind the game is to avoid different obstacles coming at you with different speeds and angles while enjoying the wonderful [music](https://timshiel.bandcamp.com/album/duet-original-soundtrack) composed by [Tim Shiel](https://soundcloud.com/timshiel). The player can only rotate the two dots right and left to avoid the obstacles. Very challenging, fun and addicting. I got inspired, and decided to implement a similar game using Processing 3 for PC.

The game is very simple: press `RIGHT` button to rotate the dots to the right and `LEFT` to rotate them to the left. However, the player has to be smart about decisions, focused, and forward looking. Hence comes the game motto: *You have to maintain a circular state of mind!*

There is an infinite number of levels, with every level, the game gets faster and more challenging. The game is beautifully animated and it rhymes very well with the wonderful original soundtracks of the mobile game while playing. The players can also save screenshots of the their high scores to share with friends and challenge them!

Finally, there are no hardware requirements (well, other than a PC with a keyboard and a monitor, duh!). Your potato PC is probably more than capable of handling the game's fantastic graphics!

Alright enough marketing! I started this project in an attempt to create quick replica of the essence of a beautiful game in `Processing3` that hasn't already been implemented by someone in [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org) community (God! those guys replicated almost every famous addictive game using Processing!). At the same time, I hope that whoever stumbles upon this can learn a thing or two. I myself am not a `Processing3` expert, but I learned some tricks.
- [Download Processing3](https://processing.org/download)
- Clone the game [repository](https://github.com/iskandergaba/Duet)
- Open `Duet.pde` with `Processing3 IDE`
- Click on `Run` and enjoy the game!
