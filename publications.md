<span class="publication-subtitle">Summary: </span>In this research, we set to implement a fully distributed version of Chi-Square (χ<sup>2</sup>) feature selection algorithm that takes full advantage of parallelism Apache Spark has to offer. Our implementation takes into account the pitfalls of the built-in algorithm and attempts to avoid them. We then bench-mark our implementations using different datasets of different size and sparsity characteristics on a variety of system configurations with different computing capabilities. Our benchmarking protocol proved that our algorithm made significant performance gains over the default algorithm in terms of both execution times and resource usage and proved to be more stable.
