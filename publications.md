<span class="publication-subtitle">Summary: </span>We implemented a fully distributed version of Chi-Square (χ<sup>2</sup>) feature selection algorithm using Apache Spark framework. Our implementation takes into account the pitfalls of the built-in algorithm and attempts to avoid them. We then bench-marked our algorithm using different datasets of different characteristics on multiple system configurations. Our benchmarking protocol proved that our algorithm made significant performance gains over the default algorithm in terms of stability, execution times, and resource management.
