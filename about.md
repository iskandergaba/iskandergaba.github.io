My name is Iskander Gaba, a Computer Science graduate student at École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble, Mobile Developer and Gamer.

I am also a car person. Roaring engines, performance suspension, manual transmission, and a heavy right foot are the way to go! Not that I have anything against the devilishly quick electric cars, but they seriously need to fix the sound issue and make their motors, somehow, roar naturally without an artificial ugly sound system.

That being said, it becomes clear why I am interested in applications of artificial intelligence on self-driving cars. This research field is the one place where my passion for computer science and enthusiasm for cool cars unite.
